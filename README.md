## Production Preflight Checklist

Before deploying, ensure these environment variables are set with real values (not placeholders):

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`
- `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
- `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`

Run this command locally to catch deployment issues early:

```bash

```

Notes:

- On Vercel/serverless, sqlite media writes are not suitable for admin uploads.
- If Cloudinary credentials are missing or invalid, uploads will fail.
